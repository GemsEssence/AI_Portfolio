# Personalized Shopping Recommendation System

## ðŸ“– Introduction
In today's digital commerce ecosystem, personalized experiences are critical to engaging customers and enhancing user satisfaction. The **Personalized Shopping Recommendation System** leverages customer demographics and behavior data to generate product suggestions tailored to each user's preferences. This system is designed to serve both existing customers with historical data and new customers with minimal input, providing relevant recommendations that enhance shopping experiences.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a scalable and intelligent recommendation system that:
- Offers personalized product recommendations based on customer attributes and browsing history.
- Supports both existing customers and new users by adapting recommendations based on available information.
- Provides meaningful explanations for recommendations to build user trust and satisfaction.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
The recommendation engine is built using Python's FastAPI framework and PyTorch for similarity computation. The system processes customer data, normalizes features, and computes similarity scores between customer profiles and products. For existing customers, browsing and purchase history are used, while for new users, recommendations are generated based on profile attributes like age, gender, and shopping segment.

Key functionalities include:
- Data preprocessing using encoding and normalization.
- Similarity computation using dot products.
- Integration with Hugging Faceâ€™s models for explanation generation.
- A REST API to serve recommendations in real time.

---

## ðŸš§ Challenges
While developing this solution, several challenges were encountered:
- **Cold-start problem**: Generating recommendations for new users with limited data required feature-based heuristics.
- **Data variability**: Handling different customer behaviors across age groups, segments, and gender.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the system could serve recommendations efficiently without performance bottlenecks.
- **Explainability**: Providing natural language explanations for recommendations to enhance user trust.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
The project is built with a modern tech stack to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability:

### Backend:
- **Python 3.12** â€“ Core programming language
- **FastAPI** â€“ Web framework for API development
- **PyTorch** â€“ Deep learning framework for feature-based similarity computation
- **Hugging Face Transformers** â€“ Language model for explanation generation
- **LangChain** â€“ Managing chains and pipelines for structured LLM interactions
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and processing
- **Uvicorn** â€“ ASGI server for fast performance
- **python-dotenv** â€“ Managing environment variables

### Frontend:

## ðŸ“Š Results
The system delivers personalized recommendations with high relevance by leveraging customer demographics and browsing behavior. The key outcomes are:
- Successful integration of both existing and new customer recommendation flows.
- Scalable API architecture using FastAPI.
- Feature-based similarity calculations yielding dynamic recommendations.
- Clear, user-friendly explanations powered by large language models.
- Improved customer experience and engagement through tailored suggestions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
The **Personalized Shopping Recommendation System** effectively combines data-driven approaches with machine learning and natural language generation to create a robust recommendation engine. By addressing challenges such as cold-start problems and scalability, this solution provides actionable and relevant recommendations to customers in real time. The modular architecture, clear data preprocessing, and explainability ensure that this system can be easily extended and adapted for various e-commerce applications.
